# mackeys
This project gives you mac-like key bindings on a Linux desktop environment and is effectively a fork of https://github.com/canadaduane/meta-mac.

The key remapping solution that this project depends on is the excellent https://github.com/rvaiya/keyd.

Assuming you have a standard-ish PC style keyboard in which the keyboard layout looks something like:
```
ctrl | windows key (aka super key) | alt (aka left-alt or lalt) | spacebar | alt (right-alt) | fn | ctrl
```

Thes tool remaps your key bindings into the following virtual keyboard layout:
```
ctrl | alt (aka left-alt or lalt or opt) | cmd | spacebar | alt | fn | windows key (aka super key)
```

Key bindings:
```

```

Note #1: An isolated keypress of the virtual left-alt key (physical windows key) is ignored so that the default Gnome behavior of moving focus to the File menu is not triggered.

# Install

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `./install.sh`
3. Edit `/etc/keyd/default.conf`, changing the `[ids]` field in lines 7-9 to identifiers that reference your keyboard(s).
   1. To identify your keyboard's identifier(s), run `sudo keyd -m` and press any key.
      ```bash
      ‚ùØ sudo keyd -m

      MX Keys Keyboard        046d:b35b       a up
      ```
   2. Note the identifier associated with each keyboard that you want to have mac-like key bindings.
      In my case, `046d:b35b` and `1044:7a3f` are the two keyboards that I want to have mac-like key bindings.
   3. Replace the `[ids]` section in the `default.conf` file with your keyboard identifiers. In my case, it looks like this:
      ```
      [ids]
      # *
      046d:b35b
      1044:7a3f
      ```
   4. Save the changes you make to `/etc/keyd/default.conf`.
4. Run `sudo systemctl restart keyd`
5. Done
